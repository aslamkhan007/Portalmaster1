                        Compelling vision, mission and value statements are an anchor for the enterprise and for IT. They help create a powerful picture of the future by increasing clarity of purpose, organizational effectiveness, and employee motivation. All too often, organizations fail to craft effective vision, mission and values statements to the detriment of organizational drive, direction and results.
